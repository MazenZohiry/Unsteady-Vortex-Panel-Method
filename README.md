# Unsteady-Vortex-Panel-Method

In unsteady aerodynamics, the load over the airfoil changes resulting in changing the vorticity distribution and hence the circulation. In order to ensure that the impermeability condition is satisfied, vortices are shed in the wake according to Kelvin's theorem. The shed vortices induce velocities everywhere in the domain including the surface of the airfoil. These induced velocities result in a lag that is experienced in the unsteady cases. The model presented is used to investigate a number of steady and unsteady flow cases, namely a steady flat plate, a steady flat plate with a flap, a pitching flat plate and finally a flat plate under a gust.
